## This is a fork of jQuery Image Annotation plugin with PHP support

Original author is Chris from [http://blog.flipbit.co.uk](http://blog.flipbit.co.uk)

Project webpage can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/jquery-image-annotate/](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-image-annotate/)

Code uses the same licence the plugin was released: GPL 2.


### How it works

I wrote a class which stores annotations into a csv file (php-api/data.csv)
with full support to delete, save and get the information from it to server 
json.


### Who uses it?

* [Romanian Free Software Group](http://softwareliber.ro) for it's [FLOSSCamp Project](http://camp.softwareliber.ro/2009/membri)


### Future plans

I hope this fork to be merged into upstream release, otherway I'm not sure I'll have enough time to support it.


### Requirements

* PHP 5
